  "milestone_title": "Build a Personal Expense Tracker with Python",
  "length": "Approximately 6-8 hours",
  "type": "exploration",
  "description": "This capstone project challenges you to apply all fundamental Python concepts learned throughout the course to develop a practical, console-based Personal Expense Tracker. You'll integrate knowledge of data types, control flow, functions, data structures like lists and dictionaries, file handling, and error management to create a functional application. This project is designed to be a significant portfolio piece, demonstrating your ability to solve real-world problems with Python and enhancing your readiness for entry-level programming roles.",
  "objectives": [
    "Design and implement a console-based Personal Expense Tracker application using core Python functionalities.",
    "Utilize **Python** data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) and control flow (conditionals, loops) to manage expense records effectively.",
    "Implement file input/output operations to persist expense data, ensuring data is saved and loaded across sessions.",
    "Apply error handling techniques to create a robust application that gracefully manages user input issues and file operations.",
    "Structure code using functions for modularity and maintainability, adhering to **Python** best practices for a portfolio-ready project."
