  "length": "10 hours",
  "type": "exploration",
  "description": "This culminating milestone challenges you to build and prepare for deployment a deep learning system designed to classify medical images, simulating a real-world application in healthcare diagnostics. You will apply foundational neural network concepts (Week 1), leverage *TensorFlow* and *Keras* for model construction and training (Week 2), implement and fine-tune advanced Convolutional Neural Network (*CNN*) architectures with *transfer learning* (Week 3), and outline a deployment strategy for your intelligent system (Week 4), consolidating your skills for a career in AI.",
  "objectives": [
    "Design and implement a robust Convolutional Neural Network (*CNN*) using *TensorFlow*/*Keras* for a medical image classification task, demonstrating proficiency in model architecture and training.",
    "Apply advanced techniques like *transfer learning*, *data augmentation*, and *hyperparameter tuning* to optimize model performance and generalization on a novel, real-world dataset.",
    "Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) and systematically debug common issues encountered during complex deep learning projects.",
    "Develop a deployment readiness plan, including *containerization* concepts (*Docker*) and cloud considerations, demonstrating an end-to-end understanding of the AI model lifecycle for production."
